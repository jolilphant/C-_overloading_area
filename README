Please create an area function with 4 different overloads to handle each of these shapes and their inputs.
You will notice that you need some extra string or bool or something to properly overload triangle and rectangle.
Circle (given its radius)
Triangle (given its base and height)
Rectangle (given its length and width)
Square (given the length of its side)
